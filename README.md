## Country App

This is a website where you can find information about 250 countries (such as flag, population, continent, capital) and play a game where you have to say the name of the country according to the flag.

I used React and Typescript.

What I've practiced/learned:
- Call an API
- useState
- useEffect
- useNavigate
- Create my own hook
- Router
- Toastify package
- Add icons
